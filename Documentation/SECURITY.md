## 🎯 Security Best Practices

### For Administrators

#### Server Configuration
```bash
# Force HTTPS
# Apache
Redirect 301 / https://yourdomain.com/

# Nginx  
return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;

# Secure PHP settings
expose_php = Off
display_errors = Off
log_errors = On
```

#### File Permissions
```bash
# Protect config file (but keep webserver-writable)
chmod 664 config.php
chown www-data:www-data config.php

# Cache directory
chmod 755 cache/
chown www-data:www-data cache/

# Protect logs from public access
chmod 640 /var/log/secstore/
```

#### Firewall Configuration
```bash
# Only open necessary ports
ufw allow 22/tcp    # SSH
ufw allow 80/tcp    # HTTP (for HTTPS redirect)
ufw allow 443/tcp   # HTTPS
ufw enable
```

### For Developers

#### Secure Coding Practices
- **Never** commit passwords or secrets in code
- **Always** use prepared statements for database queries
- **Always** perform input validation and sanitization
- **Use CSRF tokens** in all state-changing operations

#### Development Environment
```bash
# Debug mode ONLY in development
ini_set('display_errors', '1'); // ONLY in development!

# Use environment variables for secrets
DB_PASSWORD=secret_here
MAIL_PASSWORD=mail_secret_here

# Never commit config files
echo "config.php" >> .gitignore
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

#### Code Quality
```bash
# Use provided pre-commit hook
cp preCommitHook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Check code standards
vendor/bin/phpcs app/
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix
```

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Automated Testing
We recommend running these security tests regularly:

```bash
# SQL injection testing
sqlmap -u "http://localhost:8000/login" --forms --dbs

# CSRF testing
csrf-detector --url http://localhost:8000

# XSS testing
xsser --url "http://localhost:8000/search?q=test"

# SSL/TLS testing
testssl.sh yourdomain.com
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Session fixation prevention
- [ ] CSRF token validation
- [ ] XSS protection in all inputs
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] File upload security
- [ ] Access control verification
- [ ] Password complexity enforcement
- [ ] Rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Error message information disclosure
- [ ] Directory traversal protection
